3 ERC 20 tokens 


Token Alphamero - Can trade between Token Beta and Token Sigma 

Token Betasimo - Can trade to and from Token Alpha

Token Sigmalo - Can trade to and from Token Alpha

Sigmalo||Betasimo <===> Alphamero

token Alphamero should wrap Betasimo and Sigmalo. allowing the above interaction


MUST BE IMPLEMENTED: 
swap(address token_, uint amount)` and `function unswap(address token_, uint amount)`



to implement the above transactions I will use the Address of Sigmalo and Betasimo to filter for input and to
implement the logic to swap between the two: "Sigmalo||Betasimo <===> Alphamero"
